## About

This project gathers news about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Each issue in the issue tracker is a news item. All are welcome to contribute, either by providing a news items or by commenting on a news item.

## Rules

At present there are no rules, only guidelines.

1. Each issue has a subject line, which by itself gives interesting information.
2. The body of the news item has a few paragraphs of text.
3. After the body comes URLs for those who want to know more.
4. Read previous news items to see how to do it.
5. For further examples see [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/).

Please don't contribute news items about yourself, or someone who's a friend or colleague. And if you are unsure or unwilling to follow the guidelines, go ahead and ignore them. But after creating your news item, add a comment explaining the problem.

## Examples

So far we have only one issue, and no comments. We hope this will change soon.
